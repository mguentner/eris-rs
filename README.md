rust implementation of the *Encoding for Robust Immutable Storage* (ERIS) [spec](https://eris.codeberg.page/spec/).

Like the spec, this library does not implement storage backends or networking.

# State

The library implements the spec in version 1.0.0 and successfully passes all test vectors
and test streams generated through `ChaCha20` (see "5.2. Large content" in spec).

# Notes

When running the tests, make sure to use `release` builds as the performance will increase
by a factor of 100 (!):

```
cargo test --release
```
